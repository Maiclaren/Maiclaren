Hi all, I’m Michael - totally new in programming started with Python. Despite my baby steps, I love it so much! 
I’m interested in learning Python and information from all of you on how to get better!
I’m currently learning Python/HTML/CSS through a Udemy course. Pretty cool!
I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you feel I can help, if you don't mind about my noob skills, yet.. 
You can find me at maiclaren@gmail.com
